# Eliminating waste in Federal IT spending

## Summary
Information technology (IT) is an essential aspect of the government's ability to deliver effective services to the people of the United States.  Like most private businesses, Federal agencies use IT systems to interact outside and inside the government.  Due to years of mis-management and undue contractor influence, Federal information technology spending has become wildly excessive and mismanaged. In Fiscal Year 2024, the Federal IT budget for civilian agencies was approximately $74 billion, excluding the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. An assessment of Federal spending waste focused on IT alone has not been performed; however, the Government Accountability Office estimated in 2024 that at least $71 billion of cost savings and avoidance existed across the government, with IT potentially representing up to $10 billion.   Put succinctly, agencies build too many things and do so ineffectively.  There is an enormous amount of outdated legacy IT that does not meet agency mission needs effectively.  Newly built systems are heavily influenced by contractors who are incentivized to create lock-in to win future Operations & Maintenance contracts. Broadly speaking, there are multiple systemic reasons for this waste: over-regulation, outdated budget and procurement rules, duplication of work, ineffective governance, fragmented leadership, improper contractor influence and lack of direction from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  Fixing this problem requires a whole of government approach that requires action by all agencies, OMB, interagency councils and even Congress.

## Background
Federal IT policy is based on authorities from multiple pieces of legislation: Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, E-Government Act of 2002, Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (FITARA), Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act of 2017, Federal Data Strategy and Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 and the Federal Data Center Enhancement Act of 2023.  

There are multiple governmental bodies that play a part in the formulation, implementation, oversight and execution of Federal IT policy, including:
•	OMB’s Office of E-Government and United States Digital Service (USDS)
•	The Chief Information Officers Council (CIO Council) and its sub-councils and committees primarily comprised of the CIOs of the 24 CFO Act agencies
•	General Services Administration (GSA)’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) that includes multiple organizations including the Office of Governmentwide Policy, multiple Centers of Excellence and Communities of Practice, the US Digital Corps and 18F
The central body for IT policymaking is the statutorily created Office of E-Government within the Office of Management and Budget.  This office is often referred to as the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) and is headed by the Administrator referred to as the Unites States Federal Chief Information Officer.  OFCIO performs multiple functions as part of its equities: policy and guidance implementation, assisting with budget formulation, agency oversight of policy compliance, data collection and analysis.  The office also oversees multiple Federal programs that are run out of the General Service Administration including FedRAMP and the Technology Modernization Fund.  From a policy perspective, it is organized into four branches or portfolios: Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Digital Experience and Technology Modernization and Data.  These branches craft new policy in response to legislation, executive orders and other administration priorities and then oversee its implementation by agencies.  The other governmental bodies play roles in policy development and implementation coordination or provided shared services to agencies.

In the development and maintenance of IT systems, agencies are primarily guided by the following guidance:
•	The Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework, originally issued in 1999
•	OMB Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource
•	Sections of OMB Circular A-11, concerning the preparation of budgets including Technology Business Management for management and optimization of Federal IT spending
•	Various FISMA and related cybersecurity guidance

## Analysis
Within the context of the legislative, organizational and policy structure described above, there are a multitude of inefficiencies that have resulted in vast and system IT spending waste.
1.	Agencies are overburdened by memoranda, circulars, data collections and strategies.  Whole teams exist within agencies just to insulate agency leadership from the demands placed as a result.  Adherence is complex and results in slow decision-making and much time spent on tasks that do not produce value.
2.	OFCIO focuses too broadly on policy and oversight areas outside of core IT including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and digital experience.  This diffuses its focus result in a lack of meaningful new IT management policy since 2015.
3.	Government-wide technical shared services have sparse adoption and no mandate for usage.  This results in agencies building duplicative solutions that serve the same function.
4.	The Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework is a woefully outdated and burdensome approach to aligning agency mission and IT which agencies will acknowledge when asked.  In its place, they have created bespoke enterprise architecture modeling and governance approaches with varying levels of success.
5.	Agency-level CIOs have varying levels of actual authority over acquisitions and IT investment management.  Many agencies have sub-components or bureaus with their own CIOs and in many cases appropriations are done at that lower level which ties the hands of the agency CIO to manage effectively.
6.	The government workforce lacks technology program leadership skills including product management and technology management.  Government contractors have filled this gap which has effectively resulted in surrendering strategy over to them.
7.	Most agencies organize their IT workforce into silos separated from the mission teams.  This has resulted in massive disconnects between the teams defining and building IT solutions.
8.	Agencies do not use meaningful key performance metrics when managing their IT portfolios.  Because of this, they have very limited understanding of their value or effectiveness.
9.	The CIO Council, Communities of Practice and Centers of Excellence exist to bring together agencies at multiple levels to foster collaboration and coordination.  In reality, these groups do not produced meaningful outputs and waste huge amounts of time.
10.	Although OMB A-11 emphasizes the use of agile development practices in IT projects, it’s effective use is very limited for workforce, budget and acquisition reasons. 
11.	Costs for technical contractors can vary wildly across agencies due to lack of sharing of acquisition data.
12.	Agencies spend excessive amounts of time obtaining an "Authority to Operate" (ATO) for their systems which can take months and delay releases.


## Recommendations
To address the challenges presented in this memorandum, it is recommended to take the following actions:
1.	Rescind IT policy including the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework and selective OMB memoranda.
2.	Require all agencies to immediately perform an IT portfolio assessment to understand the mission effectiveness and costs of their systems and develop strategies to reduce costs and drive higher value.
3.	Move the artificial intelligence, digital experience and cybersecurity policy and oversight functions to agencies or offices that are more focused on them.  For example, cybersecurity policy can be moved to the Office of the National Cyber Director.
4.	Task TTS with building and maintaining shared technical capabilities that are required to be used by agencies.
5.	Have OMB issue lightweight and meaningful agency IT portfolio management metrics and practices which is used to drive budget and management oversight.
6.	OMB should change A-11 to stop separating IT funding for new development and maintenance. This is creating complications for the adoption of agile delivery methods.
7.	Require agencies to satisfactorily staff skilled product managers and technical architects/leads who can own the product and technical vision for IT systems and stop contractors from doing so.
8.	Additionally, require agencies to organizationally align their mission and technology teams to reduce frictions related to cross-team collaboration.
9.	Require agencies to define and implement platform strategies of reusable capabilities and require the use of these platform in their acquisition vehicles.
10.	Collect and analyze acquisitions data so that the agencies can negotiate from an informed position.
11.	Revamp the ATO guidelines and develop a continuous ATO capability that can be shared across agencies.
